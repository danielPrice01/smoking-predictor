# smoking-predictor
Overview

This project is an example of using machine learning techniques, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, to predict smoking status based on personal and health-related factors. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model building, and performance evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle: Body Signal of Smoking Dataset. It includes various personal and health-related attributes and the smoking status of individuals.

Project Structure

The project is organized into several main sections in the Jupyter Notebook:

Importing Libraries and Data: This section includes importing the necessary Python libraries and loading the dataset from Google Drive.
Data Cleaning: Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and label encoding.
Data Exploration: Data visualization using pair plots and histograms to understand the relationships between variables and their distribution concerning smoking.
Prediction: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, determining the optimal k value for the KNN model, and training the model.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy on the test data.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizing the model's performance through a confusion matrix.
